[Product Market Fit Survey](https://pmfsurvey.com/)


*How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?*

- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed (it isn’t really that useful)
- N/A – I no longer use [product]

> If you find that over 40% of your users are saying that they would be “very disappointed” without your product, there is a great chance you can build sustainable, scalable customer acquisition growth on this “must have” product.  This 40% benchmark was determined by comparing results across 100s startups.
