[Gateway Pattern](https://mattbrictson.com/blog/gateway-pattern)

> Use gateway classes to organize external API integrations and establish a clearer separation of concerns.

> Itâ€™s worth noting that the gateway pattern is often applied without using the term gateway. The term service is also popular. I prefer the term gateway because service is overloaded in the developer community and can lead to confusion.

> Where service is vague, the term gateway more clearly states its purpose: it defines a boundary between the app and an external system.
