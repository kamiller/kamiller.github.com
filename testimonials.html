        <p class="card-text">Kyle Miller was an absolute lifesaver during my search for a developer. As a non-tech founder, the challenge of ensuring that potential hires could deliver clean, high-quality code was daunting. Kyle stepped in with his expertise, meticulously vetting my developer's code before I made the hiring decision. His insights were invaluable, providing me with the confidence and peace of mind I needed to move forward. I highly recommend Kyle to anyone in need of an expert eye on coding matters.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Kyle's advice is extremely valuable.  As a struggling founder whose CTO was underwater, we needed someone to guide us on the a path that would make us successful. We were lost and needed someone to tell us exactly where we can improve our process washout fluffing things up to make us feel "good". Kyle did exactly that and told us exactly where we can improve and how my CTO can be more impactful. I saw an instant shift in the way my CTO starting thinking and approaching projects. We are now moving faster and getting things DONE!! If you ever need someone who knows their stuff and can explain it without all the fluff, Kyle’s your guy.</p>
